## Welcome to Sunnagara.org!

To begin with, the Sunnagara Project will use a custom map from OpenStreetMap to label [Silent Spaces](https://medium.com/siggu/silent-spaces-160d3a44fa3d) around planet earth. These locations are universally-accessible spaces intended (or usable for) silent meditation.

The map can be found here: https://umap.openstreetmap.fr/en/map/sunnagaraorg_382966

### How to Contribute

1. You must have physically visited this place and meditated there. It is preferable if you can stay there while you gather all the information about it. It's ideal to enter the information into Google Maps and OpenStreetMap while you are physically there as well.

2. Try to gather all information about the location possible:

  a) When is it open? When are group sittings?
  b) What kind of seating is available? (Cushions, chairs, benches, a bare floor)
  c) How do meditators get there? If the room or building is in a strange location, what are the tricks for finding it?
  d) Is there contact information for someone who can help or runs group sittings?
  e) Is this Silent Space for Vipassana (as taught by S.N. Goenka) or other/any meditation?

3. Add the location to **both** Google Maps and OpenStreetMap. Add photos you have taken, if possible. Make sure the entries match in both mapping systems, that the naming and spelling of the location match, and that you provide all relevant translations for the name.

4. For now, please submit your location suggestion to my email address attached to my GitHub account.

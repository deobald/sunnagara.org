  Suññāgāra: an empty place, an uninhabited spot, solitude.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>Suñña</strong> (adj.) 1. empty, uninhabited; void.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>Agāra</strong> (nt.) 1. house or hut; a dwelling place.

  Suññāgāra, शून्यगृह, शून्य घर, <a href="https://medium.com/siggu/silent-spaces-160d3a44fa3d">Silent Spaces</a>... these are all ways of saying "a place to meditate." When we are between our own homes and meditation centres, such places are not always easy to find. Sometimes a train station or an airport will have a meditation room. Sometimes, while traveling to a new city, we may check forums and maps for buildings where meditation is permitted or even encouraged. Often, though, these Silent Spaces are very difficult to find.

<p>
  Sunnagara.org exists to document <em>Suññāgāra</em>, Silent Spaces, for the traveling meditator. Look up your location on our map to see if there is a Silent Space nearby where you can meditate.

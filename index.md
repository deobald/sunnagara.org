<h1>What is this?</h1>

<p>
  Suññāgāra, शून्यगृह, शून्य घर, <a href="https://medium.com/siggu/silent-spaces-160d3a44fa3d">Silent Spaces</a>... these are all ways of saying "a place to meditate." When we are between our own homes and meditation centres, such places are not always easy to find. Sometimes a train station or an airport will have a meditation room. Sometimes, while traveling to a new city, we may check forums and maps for buildings where meditation is permitted or even encouraged. Often, though, these Silent Spaces are very difficult to find.
</p>
<p>
  Sunnagara.org exists to document <em>Suññāgāra</em>, Silent Spaces, for the traveling meditator. Look up your location on our map to see if there is a Silent Space nearby where you can meditate.
</p>
<p>
  <em>What exactly is a suññāgāra?</em> The Mahāsatipaṭṭhāna Sutta (Dīgha Nikāya 22: The Great Discourse on the Establishing of Mindfulness) describes three locations appropriate for meditation:
  </p>

<ol>
    <li>a forest (arrañña)</li>
    <li>the foot of a tree (rukkhamåla)</li>
    <li>an empty room (suññāgāra)</li>
</ol>

<p>
  With the upcoming advent of serious widespread meditation practice among householders, the first two options are really not practical. Beyond the obvious impracticality of finding a forest to meditate in while one is traveling internationally for work, lay meditators should not meditate outdoors in public places, even if it was as common to stumble across a forest as it was 2500 years ago. Public meditation can breed self-importance and ego. It is best to meditate indoors, as unceremoniously as possible.

<h1>Technical Details / How You Can Help</h1>

<p>
  This website is currently a bare-bones prototype. It uses OpenStreetMap to document and identify the geographical locations of Silent Spaces around the globe. With time, it would be beneficial to build a community of volunteers behind sunnagara.org, similar to those who run pariyatti.org. Until then, this website will provide a simple frontend to the OSM map which records these locations and helpful tips.
</p>

<p>
  If you would like to contribute a location to the map, please read the <a href="https://github.com/deobald/sunnagara.org#how-to-contribute">"How to Contribute"</a> section of the README on Github.
</p>

<p>
  The <a href="data/sunnagara_org.geojson">raw geojson</a> is available, if you would like a complete list of all the locations.
